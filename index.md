# Welcome
Follow me as I learn everything [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) from scratch. (Not officially affiliated)

Few things you have to know about me:
1. There will be occasional curse words here and there. If that bothers you, this channel is not for you.
2. This is not a structured tutorial for anyone to follow. It is firstly, a self-learning documentary that focuses on solving problems and technology exploration.
3. I work in the AEC Industry in my day job. My goal is to overcome architectural design, project and resource management challenges through OpenUSD and Omniverse.
4. I have basic web coding skills before heading into this journey, but will be learning Python and potentially C++ from scratch.
5. I'm a Taiwanese-American and grew up speaking 3+ languages. You're going to hear bad grammar, and see typos everywhere. Don't come after me. I'm just here to be real and share. Not to be right.
